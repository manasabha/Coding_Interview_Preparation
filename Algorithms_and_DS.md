#### Linked Lists (LL)
1. Nth from the End of LL 
    - O(1) Space O(n)
    - Use Two pointers 
    - Move one of them N times (One step at a time) and other is still at head
    - Then move both of them one step at a time until the ahead pointer is NULL
    - Now the second pointer is Nth from the End of the LL
2. Cyle Related Question
    1. Has a cyle
    2. Length of the cycle
    3. Start of a cycle
3. Reverse SLL
4. Merge Point Detection
5. Merge Sorted Lists
6. LL Palindrome
7. LL + Random Links

### Trees
Most of tree problems can be thought of graph problems and bfs/dfs can solve them.
