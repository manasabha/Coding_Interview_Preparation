#### Linked Lists (LL)
1. Nth from the End of LL 
    - O(1) Space O(n)
    - Use Two pointers 
    - Move one of them N times (One step at a time) and other is still at head
    - Then move both of them one step at a time until the ahead pointer is NULL
    - Now the second pointer is Nth from the End of the LL
